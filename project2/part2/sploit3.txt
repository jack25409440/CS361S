In target 3 count is an integer but the last parameter of memcpy is size_t, which is an unsign integer. Therefore any negative value of count will pass the if-statement. If count is -2147483547, then (size_t)count*sizeof(struct widget_t) will wrap around to 3232, which is sufficient for overflow. Then what I need to do is copy the shell code to the begining of buf set the return address as the address of buf.
